# Stickmap

An app that enables you to see and add locations of popular stickers.

## Current status

Chill bro, this has just been initialized and will take a while.

## Prerequisites

At the moment you need a Maptiler API key for the map to work. You can get your API key by creating a free account at [Maptiler](https://www.maptiler.com/).

## Configuration

For the app to work you have to create a .env file in the root directory of the project. Here is an example configuration file:
```dotenv
MAPTILER_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```
